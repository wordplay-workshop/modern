    title: Overview
    text: >+

      **Date and time**: Full day workshop on July 14<sup>th</sup> <br />

      **Location**: [NAACL hybrid workshop](https://2022.naacl.org/program/). <br />

      This workshop will focus on exploring the utility of interactive narratives, think everything from classic text-adventures like [Zork](http://textadventures.online/play/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fhugo%2Fhugozork.hex) to modern [Twine](https://twinery.org/) games, to fill a role as the learning environments of choice for language-based tasks including but not limited to storytelling. A previous iteration of this workshop took place very successfully with over a hundred attendees, also at NeurIPS, in 2018 and since then the community of people working in this area has rapidly increased. This workshop aims to be a centralized place where all researchers involved across a breadth of fields can interact and learn from each other. Furthermore, it will act as a showcase to the wider NLP/RL/Game communities on interactive narrative's place as a learning environment. The program will feature a collection of invited talks in addition to contributed talks and posters from each of these sections of the interactive narrative community and the wider NLP and RL communities.  <br />

      We like all things:

      * Interactive narrative: game playing RL agents, game generation, etc.

      * Interactive language learning

      * Natural language generation

      * Improvisational storytelling

      * And more! Anything you can think of that involves narrative, interactivity, and language!

      <br />

      **Author notification:** 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2022 (23:59 AoE) <br/>

      We welcome original research papers ranging between **4-8** pages in length (not including references or supplementary materials), formatted according to [the NAACL 2022 style](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). Submissions should be in **.pdf** format. Since the review process is **double-blind**, all papers should be appropriately anonymised. Authors have the option of submitting one supplementary manuscript containing further details of their work, it is entirely up to the reviewers to decide whether they wish to consult this additional material. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever possible. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website and will not appear in the NAACL proceedings.<br/>

      We also welcome extended abstracts of up to 2 pages that describe open problems and challenges in this area.
      The papers will be non-archival, we welcome papers that have been published or submitted to other places.
      However, authors are required to acknowledge their papers' original appearance in such cases. <br/>

      All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters.
      The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation.
