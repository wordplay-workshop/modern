      **Date and time**: November 9th, 2025 - 09:00 to 17:00 (China Standard Time)

      **Location**: Suzhou, China

      **Shared task:** [Official website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/commonsense-persona-grounded-dialogue-challenge-2025)

      ~~**Submission website:** [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2025/Workshop/Wordplay)~~

      This workshop focused on exploring the utility of interactive narratives, think everything from classic text-adventures like [Zork](http://textadventures.online/play/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fhugo%2Fhugozork.hex) to modern [Twine](https://twinery.org/) games, to fill a role as the learning environments of choice for language-based tasks including but not limited to storytelling. A few previous iterations of this workshop took place very successfully with hundreds of attendees, at NeurIPS 2018, NeurIPS 2020, NAACL 2022, and ACL 2024. Since then, the community of people working in this area has rapidly increased. This workshop aims to be a centralized place where all researchers involved across a breadth of fields can interact and learn from each other. Furthermore, it will act as a showcase to the wider NLP/RL/Game communities on interactive narrative's place as a learning environment. The program will feature a collection of invited talks in addition to contributed talks and posters from each of these sections of the interactive narrative community and the wider NLP and RL communities.  <br />

      We like all things:

      * Interactive narrative: game playing RL agents, game generation, etc.

      * Interactive language learning

      * Natural language generation

      * Improvisational storytelling

      * And more! Anything you can think of that involves narrative, interactivity, and language!

      <br />

  #     **Presentation:** All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters. The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation. <br/>

  #     **CPDC track:**

  #     We also welcome participants of [the Common-sense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/commonsense-persona-grounded-dialogue-challenge-2025) to submit technical reports to describe their submitted systems. 

  #     **Requirements:**
  #     - Papers should be ranging between **4-8** pages in length (and unlimited pages for references and supplementary materials), formatted according to [the ACL style](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Submissions should be in **.pdf** format.
  #     - Put **CPDC** as a keyword in your submission form.
  #     - Mention your CPDC team ID or team name in the technical report submission.

  #     We encourage all CPDC participants to submit and share their work. After light review, the accepted technical reports will be posted on the workshop website and will not appear in the EMNLP proceedings. All accepted technical reports will be presented as posters.

  #     Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work in a poster session (in-person or remote), the workshop committee will select a subset of submissions as spotlight talks. <br/>

        abstract: >
          In our team at Microsoft Research, we have been exploring how generative AI can transform narrative design games. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce GENEVA, a prototype tool for generating and visualizing branching narratives using large language models (LLMs). This tool allows narrative designers to develop and iterate narratives much faster than traditional tools. In the second part, I will present a case study on how generative AI can evolve game narratives in real-time based on player feedback. The goal of this work is to understand how players, game creators and generative AI can collaboratively create and evolve a game's narrative over time.

        abstract: >
          Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their impressive capabilities in various language tasks. However, traditional evaluation methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of LLMs' abilities, particularly in interactive and dynamic contexts. This talk explores the limitations of conventional benchmarks and proposes a shift towards evaluating LLM agents through interactive collaboration and competition. By engaging LLMs in multi-agent environments, we can better assess their adaptability, problem-solving skills, and social intelligence. This approach not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of LLM capabilities but also paves the way for developing more robust and versatile AI systems.
